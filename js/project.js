To learn the patterns of typical behaviours and detect anomalies, the suggested approach employs a combination of long short-term memory (LSTM)-based autoencoders. The approach takes use of the temporal character of user and entity behaviours by modelling temporal interdependence between actions and between action sequences using LSTM networks. Autoencoders are used to detect deviations from the expected baseline behaviour. The proposed approach detects abnormal behaviours of both users and entities, according to experimental results on the real-world CERT dataset. The method is evaluated using Weighted Distance Deviation (WDD) values for a user's daily actions compared to the standard action features over time. The WDD values are used to measure the deviation between a user's daily behavior and the standard behavior for their role, thus detecting anomalies as and when they occur. Overall, this study proposes a potential method for detecting abnormal behaviours of both individuals and entities in computer systems, which might be applied to a variety of applications such as cybersecurity within organizations and fraud detection.<br><br>The objective of a project on User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) using Deep Learning in the context of Information Security Management is to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to detect and mitigate security threats within an organization.
